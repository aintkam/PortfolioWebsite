# PortfolioWebsite

Hello!  This is a website I'm creating over the summer as a personal project.

My goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing portfolio website that I can put on my resume!

As of starting this project, I just finished my freshman year of college majoring in Computer Science at Louisiana Tech University.

My current plan is to become a data scientist or go into the AI/ML field, but I believe having a decent portfolio website will help me stand out.

Along with this, I also have zero webdev experience and the only languages I know are Java and Python.  

I don't entirely know what I'm doing, but the plan is to learn as I go as a Computer Scientist does!
